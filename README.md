# Coding-Challenge-9

 A library wants to create a system to manage its books, patrons, and sections.
  The system will: 
  1. Store book information, such as title, author, ISBN, and availability status. 
  2. Store section information, including section name and books within the section. 
  3. Manage patrons, allowing them to borrow and return books. 
  4. Handle different types of patrons, such as regular patrons and VIP patrons, each with unique privileges. 
  5. Track the total number of books available in each section.


In this project, I will implement a Library Management System using JavaScript classes to handle books, patrons, and library sections. Iâ€™ll use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and methods to create a scalable system. This system will allow you to manage book details, handle patrons borrowing and returning books, and calculate the total number of books available in each section.
